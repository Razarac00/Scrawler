*Turn numbers into large words. That's it.*

## The Web Application is Simple: 
it will take in any number and produce the English word(s) for that number in excessively large text, scrolling across the page. The user will of course be allowed to submit regular English and have that scroll across the screen if they so please.

## Need This Fills: 
Insofar as humor is a need, this application will satisfy that need for some comedic relief.

## Target Audience: 
Generation Z children/teens would likely find this entertaining for a good 30 seconds.

## How This Fulfills the Need: 
A quick skim of any large meme board will show evidence Gen Z's increased interaction with inane and simple humor. From 'stonks' to 'E', content and tools that provide what is ridiculous and/or what is extraordinarily useless draw excessive attention. A website entirely dedicated to giant, scrolling text fits this paradigm.
